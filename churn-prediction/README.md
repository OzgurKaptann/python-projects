# Churn Prediction Model (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **predictive machine learning model** to identify customers likely to churn.  
The model uses historical customer behavior and demographic data.

## 🎯 Business Goal
To proactively detect at-risk customers and reduce churn by enabling targeted retention campaigns.  
Early intervention leads to improved **customer lifetime value (CLV)**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Key Metrics
- Churn probability score
- Model accuracy (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- ROC curve & AUC
